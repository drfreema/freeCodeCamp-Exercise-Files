        <h2 class="subcontent" id="early-life">Early Life</h2>
          <p id="tribute-info">Assata Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron, in Flushing, Queens, New York City, on July 16, 1947.She lived for three years with her mother, school teacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill.</p>
          <p>In 1950, Shakur's parents divorced and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. After elementary school, Shakur moved back to Queens to live with her mother and stepfather (her mother had remarried); she attended Parsons Junior High School. Shakur still frequently visited her grandparents in the south.</p>
          <p>Her family struggled financially and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker who lived in Manhattan. Shakur has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was "very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i [sic] was forever asking all kinds of questions. I wanted to know everything." Williams often took the girl to museums, theaters, and art galleries.</p>
