How to contribute:
 - You should go to freecodecamp.org and do the exercises yourself.
 - This repo shouldn't be added to or forked. It really is just my exercise files from doing the boot camp.
 - I'm using this repo to learn git while I do the boot camp.

Feel free to contact me if there are any questions at dirk.freeman1@gmail.com
